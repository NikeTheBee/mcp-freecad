"""MCP FREECAD home-grown layers (cahier des charges §7).

Three token-efficient robustness layers, usable from the MCP server's
execute_python (inside FreeCAD) or standalone via freecadcmd:

- state      : persistent project memory (read at session start, updated per step)
- verify     : compact geometric verification verdicts
- checkpoint : named .FCStd saves + rollback

All paths resolve relative to the repo root (parent of /server), overridable
with the MCP_FREECAD_PROJECT_DIR environment variable.
